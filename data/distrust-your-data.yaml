excerpt: |
  With the launching of 538, Vox and the New York Times’ Upshot, it seems like the age of data journalism is finally here, greeted with both acclaim and concern by media critics. But data journalism is not a new thing. These new sites are just the latest iteration of news applications, which were an iteration of computer-assisted reporting, which was an iteration of precision journalism, all of which are just names for specific techniques and approaches used in the service of reporting the truth and finding the story. In other words, it’s journalism that starts from interrogating the data—and applies the same skepticism and rigor that we apply to the testimony of an expert contacted by traditional phone-assisted reporting.

  All of which is to say that data journalism inherits a long tradition of journalists working with data, and that comes with the heavy responsibility to get it right. Specifically, to paraphase something I heard at a NICAR conference once: fear and paranoia are the best friends a data journalist can have. I think about this often when I work with data, because I am terrified about making a dumb mistake. The public has only a limited tolerance for fast-and-loose data journalism and we can’t keep fucking it up.
