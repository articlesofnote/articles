excerpt: |
  The punched card as used for data processing, originally invented by Herman Hollerith, was first used for vital statistics tabulation by the New York City Board of Health and several states. After this trial use, punched cards were adopted for use in the 1890 census. The article on Hollerith's tabulating machine in Modern Mechanism, Appletons' Cyclopaedia of Applied Mechanics (1895, Page 832) contains illustrations of the mechanisms used to process the 1890 census.

  A brief description of the use of punched cards in the 1900 census is found in the January 1900 issue of National Geographic, pages 34-36, in an article by Dr F. H. Wines. By that time, Hollerith had also begun to work with the New York Central and Hudson Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad on applying cards to their data processing problems. The NYC&H use of punched cards was described in the Railroad Gazette on July 4, 1902, and reprinted a year later. This article has a good image of a Hollerith card from around 1900, and line-images of the tabulating machines. More early card images were published in the American Engineer and Railway Journal, Dec. 1906; page 468. All of the cards illustrated from these early railroad applications have 12 rows of 36 punch positions.
