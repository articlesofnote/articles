excerpt: |
  Shortly after Barack Obama's election, as progressive activists and Democratic operatives were jockeying for positions large and small within the new administration, Carl Malamud launched a quixotic campaign for an appointment as the director of the U.S. Government Printing Office. The public printer's task, historically, has been to compile and distribute to the American people the considerable amount of information produced each day by the federal government.

  Malamud, who has made a career of exploring and developing the transformative technology of the latter 20th and early 21st centuries, was eager to convert the job of public printer, which traces its roots to Benjamin Franklin, into an Internet-age publisher. He started a campaign for an appointment under the slogan "Yes We Scan." Rep. Ed Markey, highly regarded in the tech world, wrote a glowing letter to President Obama that described Malamud as "the best qualified individual" for the post. And members of Congress received full-color books that collected supportive "tweets."

  Although Malamud says he went on three White House interviews for the post, he was unable to win the support of the leaders of the congressional committees who oversee the GPO. But lack of an official title hasn't stopped Malamud from pursuing his open-government goals. "If called, I will certainly serve. But if not called, I will probably serve anyway," he told The New York Times last February.
